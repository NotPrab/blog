# foobar2000 Lyrics search script

**I didn't write the original script.！！！**

**Source of the script.：[github.com/EHfive/Some-js-script-for-FB2K](https://github.com/EHfive/Some-js-script-for-FB2K)**

**I've only modified it on that basis.：[github.com/wwh1004/Some-js-script-for-FB2K](https://github.com/wwh1004/Some-js-script-for-FB2K)**

**My modified version has enhanced the ability to search the lyrics of Japanese songs (mainly V's), such as the song in the image below, to match the songs sung by other singers **.

**The V's have basically the same lyrics for all their covers except for remix or something, so there's nothing particularly wrong with matching like that**
